# BEI vs. BCT Syllabus Comparison

Welcome to the BEI vs. BCT Syllabus Comparison repository! This project contains a single HTML file that encapsulates a swift, yet thorough comparison of the Bachelor of Engineering Informatics (BEI) and Bachelor of Computing Technology (BCT) syllabuses as outlined by the Institute of Engineering (IOE).

## Overview

This tool was developed in just 30 minutes to provide a quick visual and functional comparison between the BEI and BCT courses. The HTML file includes basic CSS and JavaScript necessary to view and interact with the content effectively.

 **Visual Representation:** Basic styling and scripting enhance the readability and interaction with the data.

### Limitations:

- **Course Coverage:** May not cover all courses and could be outdated; primarily focused on core syllabus elements without including electives for later semesters.

## Reference Source

The syllabuses for this comparison were taken from the following IOE official sources:
- [Computer Engineering (BCT)](https://ioesolutions.esign.com.np/semester-list/computer-engineering-bct)
- [Electronics and Information (BEI - New)](https://ioesolutions.esign.com.np/semester-list/electronics-and-information-bei-new)
